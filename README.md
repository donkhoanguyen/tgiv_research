# City Greenery Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a pipeline for processing Google Street View images and analyzing urban greenery. The main goals of this project are:

1. **Process Google Street View images**: Convert panorama images into flat, undistorted images.
2. **Calculate the TGIV (Total Green View) Index**: Measure the green view index for cities based on processed images.
3. **Build a Neural Network for Greenery Classification**: Classify urban greenery into two categories:
    - Artificial Greenery Planning (e.g., planned tree plantings)
    - Unattended Greenery (e.g., weeds, random tree growth)

## Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate the sustainability of urban environments by analyzing Google Street View images. By processing images to undistort panoramas and calculating the TGIV index, we assess the greenery coverage in different city areas. Additionally, we train a neural network to classify greenery as planned/artificial or unattended.
